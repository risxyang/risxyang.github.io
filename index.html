        <h1> hi, i'm christine </h1> </br>
        <p> I'm a third year undergrad at Yale, studying <a href="https://cpsc.yale.edu/" class="tech">computer science</a> and <a href="https://complit.yale.edu/comparative-literature-major" class="lit">literature</a>. i'm interested in creative applications of technology, immersive media, and storytelling in diverse mediums. I have experience in VR Application Development, Web Development, and Audio Show Production. </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently a literary fellow at <a href="https://www.plympton.com/" class="lit">Plympton</a>, working on their short story atlas.
        </p>
        <p>
            On campus, I lead production of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ydnpodcast" class="lit">Attune</a>, an audio fiction anthology, with the <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/" class="lit">Yale Daily News</a>. I also develop with and write newsletters for for <a href="https://ccam.yale.edu/get-involved/yale-student-immersive-media-club" class="tech">Yale Student Immersive Media</a>, an undergraduate collective which experiments with VR Applications. As a sophomore, I brand managed <a href="https://yhack.org/" class="tech">yale's coolest hackathon.</a>

            In 2019, I was a <a href="https://light.yale.edu/" class="lit">Yale Light Fellow</a>, and I studied advanced Mandarin Chinese in Beijing on a full scholarship.

            In 2018, I was Georgia's German student of the year. I've studied on scholarship at the <a href="https://www.goethe.de/ins/de/en/ort/fre.html" class="lit">Goethe-Institut Freiburg</a> (courtesy of AATG) and in NÃ¼rnberg on the <a href="https://www.aatg.org/page/StudyTripAward" class="lit">AATG-Pedagogical Exchange Service </a>Study Trip Award. AP German students may hear my voice as a training sample for the cultural presentation part of the exam :-)

            Some time ago, I played a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/W3tgXrqHw6I" class="other">c</a>lassical musi<a href="https://youtu.be/B0buhZhnEjk" class="other">c</a>. I was in a chamber group as a first-year in college, which I really enjoyed, and i'm currently self-teaching guitar in my free time.
