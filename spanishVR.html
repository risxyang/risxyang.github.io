          <h1>Spanish Learning in VR</h1>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/noahs921/scsu_spanish" class="tech">Link to Github Repo</a> / Built with C# in Unity and Blender</p>
          <!-- <blockquote>"Welcome to Girona, Spain. It is January 30, 1939, and the Spanish Civil War has been underway for two and a half years. You are a prison guard who works for the government of the Second Spanish Republic. Your job is to monitor Sanchez Mazas, who is one of your political prisoners." -- Simulation Intro</blockquote> -->
          <p>In this simulation, a student decides how to respond to political figure Sanchez Mazas's famed prison break. Through the experience, the student also learns the Spanish names of food items and is exposed to imperative sentence structure. Premise developed by professors at <a href="https://www.southernct.edu/" class="tech">Southern Connecticut State University.</a> Simulation built by Noah Shapiro, Zodi Chalat, and myself. Screenshots of the current iteration of the experience are below.</p>

        <p>Among other things, I wrote the code for the interaction with vocabulary items. Upon directing their controller at a vocabulary item, the player will see a pop-up with the Spanish name of the object, as well as directions to hear a sound clip of the name spoken aloud. See a glimpse of this feature in the gif below, in the pre-experience "training" world, where players familiarize themselves with the basic VR interactions. </p>

        <p>This experience was developed entirely remotely during Fall 2020. It was first demoed in person in November.</p>
