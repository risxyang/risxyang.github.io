            <h3>VR Experience for Introductory Spanish Students</h3>
            <h6>Built in Unity3D, with use of Blender for creating environmental assets. As one of three undergraduate developers on the technical side of the project, I had a main role in choosing and creating visual assets, lighting the scene, and writing C# scripts to control player interaction in the experience. The premise, involving a political figure's prison break in the Spanish Civil War, was developed by professors at SCSU.</h6>
            <h6>GIF showcases a prototype of the visual feel of an interaction with a character in the scene. I integrated animations from Mixamo into the animation timeline in our Unity project and controlled the basic lighting in this scene; I also researched available visual assets on the Unity store and made a pitch for the low-poly aesthetic. </h6>
