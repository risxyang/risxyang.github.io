 					In a highschool CS course, I was asked to write a program for our final assessment. I was (and still am) extremely excited about learning German, so I made a game to facilitate learning for other students. Unlike software that teaches pure language acquisition, this game focused on highlighting cultural differences. A player might come away knowing a thing or two about the education system and one's lifestyle in another country.

 					I settled on a design that would be kid friendly. In my school district, we don't have a steady foreign language program for kids K-7; in eighth grade, our middle school offered Spanish, and it was mandatory. I hoped that a game like this might pique a kid's interest, pulling on intrinsic motivation to explore in a new world. Even if they don't have a language program in their school, they might find this game through the internet, and then they'd be able to learn through it. I also took into account the possibility that an educator might want to use this game in the classroom.

 					<p> <h2> market feature (incentive) </h2> <p> Through interacting with humans in the world, the player acquires points (which are displayed in the bottom left corner of the game). These points can be spent at the  market, which is accessible through approaching the market building. </p> </p>

 					<p> <h2> purchasing the goods </h2>   <p> the player wins by collecting all food items. </p> </p>

 					<p> <h2> customizing the game </h2> <p>  I wanted to make the game customizeable for educators. If they wanted  to use this in their classroom, they'd be able to change some lines through a text editor quite easily.  </p> </p>
