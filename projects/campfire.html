            <h2>CAMPFIRE</h2>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/QuantumArjun/Campfire" class="plain">[Link to Github Repo]</a> / React, Socket.io</p>
        <p> 
            Campfire is a collaborative storytelling webapp, built Fall 2020. It is meant to be played as a turn-based game. My co-creators and I developed the idea in quarantine, as we passed time by doing online activities together over group calls. Existing games like <a href="https://tiermaker.com/" class="plain">Tierlist Maker</a> and <a href="https://skribbl.io/" class="plain">Skribble.io</a> served as our inspiration. 
            </p>
        <p>
           Features in the game include: private rooms you can create and join with anybody in the world, and  enforced minimum / maximum word limits for both individual turns and the overall story. 
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            The current iteration of Campfire can be accessed <a href="https://campfire-stories-frontend.herokuapp.com/" class="plain">[at this link.]</a> The site takes a minute or so to load the first time around. Invite a friend to join on the other side, with your game's special Secret Word, or try joining your own room from a new tab, under a new name.
        </p> -->
        <p>
            Future additions to the game include a UI/UX revamp, export ability for the story, an enforced time limit to each turn (which should make the game aspect of this more challenging and fun), and potentially some NLP features for smart topic suggestions and supplementary graphic generation by the server.
